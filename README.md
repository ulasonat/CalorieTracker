## Description
Calorie Counter is a web-based service that allows users to track the amount of calories they have consumed over a selected period of time. Users are given accounts to save their consumption history, and can select from a variety of food options to add to their daily sum of calories. The service uses cloud services and an API from a 3rd party provider with an extensive database of food selection.

## Documentation
The project documentation can be accessed within the project folder as a PDF file named Documentation.pdf.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run launch`
Installs all the modules and runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The app is bundled for production, and the build is optimized for the best performance. The file names are hashed and minified. The app is then ready to be deployed. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

This command removes the single build dependency from your project. Instead, it copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so that you can adjust them. You should only use `eject` when you are ready to customize your build tool and configuration choices.
